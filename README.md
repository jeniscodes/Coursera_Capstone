# Kathmandu_Lalitpur_City_Wards_Study
This repository is created for 'Battle of Neighborhoods' capstone project for IBM data science professional certificate provided by Coursera.


Kathmandu and Lalitpur are two biggest cities of Nepal . Although being two different cities they are almost like a combined city for residents of these two metropolitian cities as  daily thousands of people cross these two cities for  their normal routine.

For this project we want to classify different wards of these two cities on the basis of venues  to study both city as one and look out the places which mirrors each other or acts as one unit . We are also taking look at the population density of these wards for detail information. This project would be really insightful for inhabitants who want to explore different wards of both cities on basis of their desire venues and population.
